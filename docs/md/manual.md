Boson framework user manual
---------------------------

This documentation will walk you into each feature of the library.

# Getting started

*Warning*: as of January 2017, the `boson`framework only supports Linux.

## Third parties

`boson` uses a bunch of small third party libraries. Most of them are either header only or built directly into the `boson` library. All of their code is packaged within the `boson` repository. You dont have to download them and there is no submodule to retrieve.

## Build `boson`

To build the `boson` framework, you need `CMake` and a C++14 compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duckie/boson
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

`libboson` (the whole framework binary part) and 'libfmt' ([awesome string formating tool](http://fmtlib.net)) are availables in `build/lib` as static libraries. It is *highly recommended* not to use `boson` as a shared library.

## Quick tutorial

We will start with a very simple program and explain each part of it. Dump this content in a file, say `main.cc`:

```c++
#include "boson/boson.h"
#include "boson/channel.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  boson::run(1, []() {
    using namespace boson;

    channel<std::string, 2> msg_chan;

    start([](auto chan) -> void {
      std::string received_message;
      while (chan >> received_message)
        std::cout << received_message << "\n";
    }, msg_chan);

    start([](auto chan) -> void {
      chan << "Hello world !";
      chan.close();
    }, msg_chan);
  });
  return 0;
}
```

Then compile it:

```bash
clang++ main.cc -std=c++14 -I${BOSON_DIR}/src/boson -L${BOSON_DIR}/build/lib -lboson -lpthread
```

And execute `a.out` to test it.

### Engine startup

```c++
boson::run(1, []() {});
```

This line starts a boson engine with one thread and a routine in it. It is not mandatory to launch the engine with only one routine, but this is good practice since some particular contructs (such as channels) must be created from a boson routine. This call blocks until every routine has finished execution. This can be seen as the "master event loop".

*Tip*: The engine does not use any global variable. That means you can launch as many instances of the engine that you want in the same executable.
